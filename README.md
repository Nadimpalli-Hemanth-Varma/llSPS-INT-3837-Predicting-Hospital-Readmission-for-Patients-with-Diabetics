#Predicting Hospital Readmission for Patients with Diabetics
A hospital readmission is when a patient who is discharged from the hospital, gets re-admitted again within a certain period of time.
Hospital readmission rates for certain conditions are now considered an indicator of hospital quality, and also affect the cost of care adversely.
For this reason, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services established the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program which aims to improve quality of 
care for patients and reduce healthcare spending by applying payment penalties to hospitals that have more than expected readmission rates for certain conditions.
Being able to determine factors that lead to higher readmission in such patients, and correspondingly being able to predict which patients will get readmitted can
help hospitals save millions of dollars while improving quality of care
